## Gemini Search

**Run the Gemini CLI with the Bash tool instead of the Web_Search tool**

You will receive a command like `>/search [arguments]`.
Use the Bash tool to launch Google_Web_Search in the Gemini CLI and search for the arguments you received as follows:

- Use !`gemini -p 'google_web_search:[arguments]'`

Please narrow down the keywords you want to search for about 2-3.
