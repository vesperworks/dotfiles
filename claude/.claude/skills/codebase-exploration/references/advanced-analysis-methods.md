# Advanced Analysis Methods

## Overview

This document provides advanced techniques for comprehensive codebase analysis beyond basic exploration.

## Multi-layer Dependency Analysis

### Technique 1: Call Graph Tracing
- Identify function call hierarchies
- Map data flow between modules
- Detect circular dependencies

### Technique 2: Impact Scope Mapping
- Analyze change propagation paths
- Identify affected test suites
- Evaluate refactoring complexity

## Pattern Recognition

### Common Architectural Patterns
- Identify design patterns in use (Factory, Observer, Strategy, etc.)
- Recognize anti-patterns and code smells
- Evaluate pattern consistency across codebase

### Code Structure Analysis
- Module cohesion measurement
- Coupling evaluation
- Interface boundary identification

## Performance Hotspot Detection

### Static Analysis
- Complexity metrics (Cyclomatic complexity, Cognitive complexity)
- Resource usage patterns
- Algorithmic efficiency evaluation

### Dynamic Considerations
- Potential bottlenecks identification
- Cache-friendly code patterns
- Parallelization opportunities

## Best Practices

1. Always start with high-level architecture overview
2. Use multiple analysis techniques for comprehensive understanding
3. Document findings systematically
4. Consider both technical and business context
5. Validate findings with stakeholders

## Tools and Techniques

- Static code analysis tools
- Dependency visualization tools
- Performance profiling integration
- Documentation generation from code structure
