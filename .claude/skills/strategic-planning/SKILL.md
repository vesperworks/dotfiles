description: Strategic planning and requirements architecture for complex features. Includes requirement analysis and SOLID principles validation (integrated from requirements-architect). Use when defining requirements, evaluating technical approaches, making architectural decisions, assessing risks, or creating implementation roadmaps. Specializes in user needs clarification, SOLID principle-based design evaluation, technical feasibility verification, and phased implementation planning.

# Strategic Planning + Requirements Architecture

## Core Purpose

Define clear requirements and create strategic implementation plans for complex features, ensuring alignment with SOLID principles.

## Basic Workflow

### Step 1: Requirement Clarification
- User needs identification
- Use case definition
- Success criteria establishment

### Step 2: SOLID Evaluation (Integrated Capability)
- Single Responsibility Principle validation
- Open/Closed Principle assessment
- Liskov Substitution Principle check
- Interface Segregation Principle review
- Dependency Inversion Principle verification

### Step 3: Technical Feasibility
- Technology stack evaluation
- Constraint identification
- Risk assessment

### Step 4: Implementation Roadmap
- Phased approach design
- Milestone definition
- Resource estimation
